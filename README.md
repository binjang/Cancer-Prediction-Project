# Cancer-Prediction-Project
This was the final (group) project for "Introduction to Machine Learning" on Fall 2020 semester.
We made created and analyzed multiple machine learning models that predicts(identifies) cancer within the given data, on R studio environment.

'cancer_data.xlsx' contains the dataset that we were given.
'Final Project Submission.pdf' documents the preprocessing and the machine learning models that we created and analyzed using the given canter dataset.
